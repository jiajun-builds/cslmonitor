"""Turning fitted attack/defence coefficients into an honest overall strength.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The dashboard used to rank clubs by ``attack_coef - defence_coef``. Under the
log-linear mean structure of ``ContinuousPoissonGoalModel`` that difference is::

    atk - dfn == log(lambda_for / lambda_against)

against an average opponent — a pure **ratio**, blind to the absolute goal level.
So a 2.2-scored/1.6-conceded club and a 1.2/0.9 club score identically, even
though they are not equally good at winning matches.

At a fixed ratio, playing higher-scoring matches scales up the absolute expected
goal difference, and that amplifies a club's standing in whichever direction it
already points. Measured on a realistic field, two clubs tied at ``atk - dfn ==
+0.30`` rate +0.356 and +0.220 (the higher-scoring one is genuinely stronger),
while two tied at ``-0.30`` rate -0.350 and -0.297 (the higher-scoring one is now
*worse*). The naive difference collapses each pair to a single number. The
practical consequence on the dashboard was a leaky, high-scoring club sitting
too high in the lower half of the table.

The quantity that does answer "who is best overall" is expected points per match
against the actual league field. Measured against that ordering on the 2026 CSL
field, the naive difference misorders 3 of 120 pairs (worst error 2 places); the
rating below reproduces it exactly, by construction.

What ``calibrated_rating`` is
-----------------------------
Not a points forecast — a **rating**, on the same scale and of the same
magnitude as the old ``atk - dfn``, so the column reads as it always did. It
answers: *what symmetric rating gap ``r`` (attack ``+r/2``, defence ``-r/2``)
would make a club as strong as this one?* Since it is a monotone reparametrisation
of expected points, equal rating now genuinely means equal strength, and 0 is
exactly league average.

All functions here are pure — they take coefficients and the two fitted scalars,
never a model instance — so they are cheap to test and safe to call from an
export path.
