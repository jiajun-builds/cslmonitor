"""Scheduler "tick": capture opening lines only when a fixture is in its window.

Phase 3 of the scheduled odds-capture pipeline (AGENTS.md roadmap #2). Meant to be
run frequently (e.g. every ~10 min by launchd/cron — Phase 4). Each tick:

  1. Builds predicted open windows from ``opening_calendar`` (local CSVs only, no network).
  2. Finds fixtures whose window ``[open_from, open_to]`` contains "now" AND that have
     no ``snapshot_type=open`` row in the history yet ("pending").
  3. If none are pending, exits doing nothing — an idle tick costs zero API quota.
  4. Otherwise spends ONE ``/odds`` request (the whole slate comes back at once),
     keeps only the pending fixtures' rows, and appends them as ``open``.

Because one request returns every fixture, several simultaneously-in-window matches
are covered by a single call. Non-in-window fixtures in that same response are
DISCARDED — each fixture's ``open`` row must be its own true opening line, so a
fixture is only ever stored as ``open`` while it is inside its own window.

Quota guard: the free plan is capped, so before spending we read remaining quota
from the free ``/sports`` endpoint and abort below ``--min-remaining``.

Usage (repo root, PYTHONPATH=src, THE_ODDS_API_KEY set):
    python -m csl.odds.capture_scheduler
    python -m csl.odds.capture_scheduler --dry-run   # decide only, spend/write nothing

# The scheduler's *capture* window is deliberately wider than the ~1h *display*
# window (opening_calendar.DEFAULT_WINDOW_HOURS) it is derived from. The Odds API
# lists fixtures in waves, so a fixture's feed entry (or Pinnacle's posted line) can
# appear only AFTER the validated 1h open window has closed; with a 1h capture bound
# such a fixture is never seen inside its window and its opening line is lost forever
# (observed on round 18: Shanghai Port vs Dalian Yingbo). Widening the *capture* bound
# to [anchor, min(anchor + this, kickoff)] lets a still-uncaptured fixture be grabbed
# on first feed availability after its window, at 10-min freshness.
#
# 6h → 12h (2026-07-16): 6h still missed opens that posted later (user-reported). 12h
# is essentially free in the normal case — a fixture is captured ~1h after its anchor
# and drops out immediately, so the wider bound only keeps polling for genuinely-late
# opens, which is the point. A late open costs ~1 credit per 10-min tick until it
# posts, so the bound stays finite rather than running to kickoff; anything later than
# 12h (or missed while the 10-min workflow was cron-throttled, or a fixture with no
# schedulable anchor) is caught quota-free by the 3h Now-refresh fallback
# (csl.odds.backfill_open). opening_calendar caps open_to at kickoff either way.

# two REQUIRED_OPEN_BOOKS below.

# The books a fixture must have an ``open`` row for before it stops being pending.
# Both are load-bearing for the dashboard: Pinnacle's open is the λ de-bias anchor,
# 1xBet's open is the displayed bet price / EV basis / signal price
# (export_upcoming_market_comparison). A fixture keeps firing (1 credit/tick) until
# BOTH are captured or its window closes — this is the point of P0-1: the earlier
# Pinnacle-only rule stopped ticking the moment Pinnacle opened, so a 1xBet line that
# posted later than that single tick was lost, leaving the fixture with no bet price.
# Requiring BOTH is strictly *stricter* than the old rule (never looser), so it can
# never let an early-opening rival stop the ticks before Pinnacle's anchor is stored.
# Bounded by the 12h capture window + kickoff cap + the min-remaining quota guard, and
# any genuine miss is caught quota-free by the 3h Now-refresh fallback (backfill_open).
# Recon-only books (betfair/matchbook) are deliberately NOT required: they have patchy
# coverage (matchbook 4/8 fixtures) and would burn a fixture to window-close every time.
