"""Fallback opening-line capture from the 3h Now-line refresh (roadmap #6/#8 gap fix).

The 10-min ``capture_scheduler`` grabs a fixture's opening line only while "now" is
inside its predicted window ``[anchor, min(anchor + capture-window, kickoff)]``. Three
things can still leave a fixture with a Now line but **no** captured open:

  1. Pinnacle posts the line later than the capture window (feed-lag beyond 12h);
  2. the 10-min capture workflow was throttled/skipped by GitHub cron across the
     whole window;
  3. the fixture has no schedulable anchor (a team's previous match is missing from
     the schedule), so it never gets a window at all.

All three used to surface as "dashboard shows current odds but no opening odds".

This module is the safety net. It runs inside the every-3h Now-line refresh — which
already fetches the whole capture slate (all CAPTURE_BOOKMAKERS), so it costs **zero
extra quota** — and, for each of ``REQUIRED_OPEN_BOOKS`` (Pinnacle anchor + 1xBet bet
price), records the current line as a fallback ``open`` for any fixture that has a Now
line but no captured open for that book **and whose primary capture window has already
closed** (or never existed). The window-closed guard means the 10-min capture keeps
first crack at a fresher open while the window is still live; only genuine misses are
backfilled.

The recorded price is the line as it stands at this refresh — the best opening proxy
available once the true-open window is gone — and ``capture_reason`` marks it as a
fallback so it is never mistaken for a window-fresh open.

Usage (invoked by ``scripts/csl.sh`` after the Now-line fetch; also runnable directly):
    python -m csl.odds.backfill_open
    python -m csl.odds.backfill_open --dry-run
