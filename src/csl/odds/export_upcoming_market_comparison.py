"""
Export upcoming CSL fixtures as an **opening-line bet-signal board** (dashboard
v2.8). Each fixture carries de-biased model 1X2 probabilities, every bet book's
OPENING 1X2 price, model EV against each, and a betting signal flag priced on the
**best** of them, per the backtest.md §13.4 recommended config.

Three books, two distinct roles (they are NOT interchangeable):

  * **Pinnacle open — the de-bias anchor** (never displayed, never bet). Pinnacle
    is the sharp reference; its opening no-vig draw is the target the draw shrinks
    toward. This keeps the model probability identical to the all-pairs
    prediction surface (one coherent prob per fixture).
  * **1xBet + Duel opens — the bet prices** (``books.BET_BOOKS``). Cheap books
    (~4.9% and ~3.0% open overround vs Pinnacle's ~7.5%, backtest.md §13), so the
    same edge can clear the vig wall. EV, the displayed Open odds and the signal
    all live here.

Best price, not "the cheaper book" (2026-08-08)
----------------------------------------------
EV is scored against ``max(odds)`` across ``BET_BOOKS`` per outcome, because that is
the price we would actually take. Choosing one book by its headline overround would
be wrong: measured the day Duel was wired in, its overround was ~2.4pp lower than
1xBet's on *every* fixture, yet 1xBet still held the better price on a third of
outcomes. Duel's advantage sits almost entirely in the **draw**, which
``SIGNAL_ALLOW_DRAW = False`` means we never bet; on home/away the two books split
evenly. Per-outcome best price was worth +2.06% mean on those sides.

⚠️ ``SIGNAL_EV_MIN`` was calibrated on 1xBet **alone** (§13.4), and a max over books
is upward-biased, so best-of-two fires strictly more signals at the same threshold.
The per-book EV columns are retained precisely so 1xBet-only can be reconstructed
and the threshold re-derived; see ``BET_OPEN_COLUMNS``.

Draw de-bias is hybrid (AGENTS.md roadmap #10, validated in backtest.md §12):

  * Fixture WITH a captured PINNACLE opening 1X2 -> market-anchored shrink at
    ``DEBIAS_LAMBDA``: starting from the RAW (un-δ'd) model grid,
    ``p'_D = (1-λ)·p_D + λ·m_D`` where ``m_D`` is Pinnacle's no-vig opening draw
    probability; the freed mass is returned to H/A pro-rata. Anchoring on the
    raw grid (``predict_raw``) avoids stacking λ on top of the δ calibration.
  * Fixture WITHOUT a captured Pinnacle open -> the ``predict`` path, which since
    backtest.md §15.3 applies **no** draw correction (δ is retired,
    ``DRAW_DELTA_SHRINK = 0.0``) and therefore returns the raw grid.

At the shipped ``DEBIAS_LAMBDA = 1.0`` the anchored draw is exactly ``m_D``, so the
model contributes only the home/away split; see §15.4 for why 1.0 rather than the
measured argmax of 1.25.

The ``debias_method`` column records which path produced each row's
probabilities ("market_anchor" or "delta"). EV is computed per book against that
book's opening price, ``{prefix}_EV_k = p'_k * {prefix}_odds_k - 1``, and again
against the best price as ``best_open_{k}_ev``.

Signal (backtest.md §13.4, §15.4): pick = argmax EV over ``SIGNAL_SIDES`` —
**{home, away} only**, draws cannot fire (``SIGNAL_ALLOW_DRAW = False``) — priced on
the **best** open; ``signal_state`` is "bet" when that pick's EV > ``SIGNAL_EV_MIN``
and its odds <= ``SIGNAL_ODDS_CAP``, "odds_cap" when the EV clears but the
long-shot cap does not, "" otherwise. ``signal_book`` names the book to bet;
``signal_books`` lists every book independently clearing both bars (the board's
logos) and is populated only on a "bet" row — see ``attach_signals``.

#
# Why exactly 1.0 and not the measured argmax (1.25, gap +3.58 vs +3.32): λ>1
# extrapolates PAST the market draw, which gives p_D a *negative* weight on the
# model's own draw estimate — and §15.3 showed that estimate's bias changes sign
# season to season (2023 +0.81pp, 2025 -4.37pp). Depending negatively on an

# independent of the model, so that instability cannot propagate. λ=1.0 captures
# ~93% of the available gap, and 1.25 was chosen by argmax on the evaluation set —

    This is the execution layer: for a given fixture and side we would take whichever
    book pays more, so that is the price EV must be computed against. It is *not* a
    "pick the cheaper book" rule — book-level overround and per-outcome price are
    different things. Measured 2026-08-08: Duel's overround was 2.4pp lower than
    1xBet's on every fixture, yet 1xBet held the better price on a third of outcomes
    and on the away side specifically 2 times in 3. Duel's cheapness lives almost
    entirely in the draw, which SIGNAL_ALLOW_DRAW excludes from betting.

    Tie-break: books are scanned in ``BET_BOOKS`` order with a strict ``>``, so an
    exact tie goes to the earlier book (1xBet). That determinism is load-bearing —
    ``signal_book`` derives from this and forms part of the Telegram dedup key, so a
    tie-break that could flip would re-alert every run.

    Sides nobody has priced get ``NaN`` odds/EV and ``""`` for the book: never
    ``-inf``, never ``0``, so downstream ``notna()`` gates behave exactly as they did
    for an uncaptured fixture in the single-book world.

    ``signal_pick`` is the outcome with the highest **best-price** EV among the
    ``SIGNAL_SIDES`` that any book has priced — home/away only by default, see
    ``SIGNAL_ALLOW_DRAW``; ``signal_state`` is:

      * "bet"      — pick EV > SIGNAL_EV_MIN and pick odds <= SIGNAL_ODDS_CAP.
      * "odds_cap" — pick EV > SIGNAL_EV_MIN but odds over the long-shot cap
                     (surfaced, greyed, not a bet — §13.4b).
      * ""         — no pick clears the EV floor (or no book has opened).

    ``signal_book`` is the book quoting that best price — the one to actually bet.
    ``signal_books`` is every book that *independently* clears both bars on the picked
    side, "|"-joined in ``BET_BOOKS`` order; it drives the logos on the board.

    Why ``signal_books`` is emitted ONLY when state == "bet"
    -------------------------------------------------------
    State is decided on the best price, ``signal_books`` on each book separately, so
    they can disagree: if the best price is over the odds cap while a second book's
    price is under it and still clears EV, the row is greyed "do not bet" — and
    showing a bettable book's logo on it would be incoherent. Emitting nothing there
    keeps one invariant true everywhere: state == "bet" iff signal_books is non-empty,
    and every displayed logo is a bet you should actually place.

    The cost, recorded deliberately: adding a second book can therefore *remove* a bet
    that 1xBet alone would have fired. This is the same "argmax EV first, then apply
    the cap" ordering the single-book version already used (§13.4b treats the odds>7
    tail as the least-edge slice), now applied to a cross-book price. Measured rarity:
    1 of 68 captured home/away opens ever exceeded odds 7, and the divergence needs a
    stricter conjunction than that.
